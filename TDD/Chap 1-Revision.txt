Test Driven Development
	Develop our code using testing mechanism
	We would start designing the application/integrate our logic 	with design only after ensuring that logic is working 100%
	Through TDD we can get the structure of the modules and their 	inter-relationships

Types of Testing
	Black box testing
		code is not exposed to tester
		allows to test application as a whole

	White box testing
		code is exposed to tester
		allows to test application in units


Unit Testing
	Testing each unit separately

Integration Testing
	Testing each module separately
	one module will consist of many units

System Testing
	Testing the application as a system
	Application would consist of many modules

Regression Testing
	Testing the code after updation

Acceptance Testing
	Testing the application on client's computer and letting the 		client accept the application

Performance Testing
	working speed,response time,load on the computer,memory 		occupancy

To implement testing java provides us Junit
	
	Test

	Test case
	
	Test Runner

	Test suite

	Test Result

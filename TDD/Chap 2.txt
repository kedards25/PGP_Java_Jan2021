To make our project portable we require maven based project

	Maven is a tool that provides us the required jar files which 	are known as dependencies
	To implement maven in our project,we need to configure 	pom.xml=>Project Object Model
	visit mvnrepository.com and copy the required dependency 	configuration
	when we share our project with others over mail/any other 		resources,the other person has to right click on the project 	and update maven
	Maven will check for dependencies configured in pom.xml and 
	download the dependencies online

in Factory pattern we will have a class called as factory class with a factory method
any method is called as factory method when it returns an object of the class


class Demo	//factory class
{
	public Demo getObj()	//factory method
	{
		Demo d=new Demo();
		return d;
	}
}

class Products
{
	int productId;
}

create table products
{
	prodId int primary key identity(100,1)
}

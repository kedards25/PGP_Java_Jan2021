Web Technologies

	Whenever we type any url in the address bar we are actually 	requesting the server for mentioned url
	In return,server processes the request and sends response to 	client
	Communication over web includes request and response cycle

	CGI
		Common Gateway Interface
		used to create separate instance of CGI script for 		multiple requests from same client,thereby reducing the 		performance of server

	Servlet
		The major difference between servlets and CGI was that,	
		CGI used to create separate instance for each request 		whereas Servlets used threading,allowing server to 		handle concurrent requests at the same time with same 		instance

	JSP
		Java Server Pages
		Powerful successor of servlet technology.
		It was created to eliminate the complexity in servlets.
		JSP page after compilation,generates sevlet,thereby 			allowing us to implement all the functionalities of 			servlets

	PHP

Any application can be divided into
	Design	=> Presentation Layer
	Logic	=> Bussiness Layer
	DB	=> Database Layer

	based on where these layers reside,we can have software architecture


One-Tier/Single Tier Architecture

	All three layers would be on same computer

	Pro's
	No need of multiple computers and hence no need of network
	Low maintainance cost
	ease of access

	Con's
	slow processing
	data loss in case of crash(No-backup facility available)
	cannot be accessed over the network(no remote access)
	not-Portable
	single user oriented

Two Tier Architecture
	PL+BL		DL
	Client		Server architecture
	Fat Client	Thin Server


	PL		BL+DL
	Thin client	Fat Server


	Pro's
	Multi-user oriented
	Remote access possible
	Backup facility available
	Fast Processing
	storage can be expanded as needed

	Con's
	More maintainance cost
	Network is compulsary
	Update/Upgrade has to be done on each client separately/individually

Three Tier
	PL		BL		DL

	Pro's
	update is released OTA => Over The Air

	Con's
	Cost
	For each request,client takes round trip from the server
	Whenever there is round trip from the server,page refreshes

	
N-tier Architecture
	PL		BL		DL
		AJAX		Disc
				env

	AJAX allows to achieve partial page reloading/refreshing
	     helps sending part of the web page to be processed to the server
	     Async Javascript And XML
		Async=>it is not in sync with page hence we can interact with rest of 			the page while the particular part is being updated
		
		Javascript=>Handles interaction at client side

		XML=>communicates data with server

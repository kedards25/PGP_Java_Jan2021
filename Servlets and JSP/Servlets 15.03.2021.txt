Conversion from .java to .class

.class file is loaded into web container

instance of the class is created

init() method is invoked =>responsible for initialising object and members of class

service() method is invoked=>responsible for processing the request and generate response

destroy() method is invoked=>responsible for deallocation of memory which is not in use

=============================================================

if we want few values to be initialised as soon as the servlet is loaded/initialised then we can configure those values in servlet mapping of web.xml file using init-param

if we want few values to be initialised as soon as the application is loaded/initialised then we can configure those values outside servlet mapping of web.xml file using context-param

===============================================================
Servlets and JSP

in servlets, we write html within Java whereas in JSP we write Java within HTML

index.jsp==>errPage.jsp

errorPage="errPage.jsp"

on errPage.jsp	=>isErrorPage="true"

when we want to display java values in jsp we use ExpressionLanguage(EL)
